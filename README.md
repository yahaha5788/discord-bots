### A bot for infinitely customizable color roles!

The Polaroid is a discord bot made for color roles. It allows for any user to have their own custom username color through a role (ex. sc.00FFFF), as well as copying other users' supercolors and a command to show their own

It also allows for server admins to disable / enable colors of some colors are reserved for certain roles. Colors in a range from that color are also disabled to avoid users slightly changing a hexcode as a workaround

The Polaroid also has commands for showing a given color, and conversion supporting hexcodes, rgb values, and hsv values.
